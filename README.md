# Tag-Arena
Players spawn in an arena and one random player is designated as It. The player who is It must tag another player to transfer the It status. The game continues until a timer runs out, and the player who was It the longest loses. 

This project isn't finished yet.
It has some bugs and glitches that are yet to be fixed like :
1. Player goes outside wall .
2. Connection issues when 2 player join , they join as a same player .
